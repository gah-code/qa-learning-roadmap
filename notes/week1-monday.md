## Group A — SDLC vs STLC

### Software **Developmen**t Life Cycle

- Phases of the SDLC:
- Planning - determine
- Analysis - gather
- Design - create
- Development -build
- Testing - review
- Deployment - fix
- Maintenance - support

- (add 5–8 bullets)

### Software **Testing** Life Cycle

- Requirement Analysis
- Test Planning
- Test Design
- Test Environment
- Test Execution
- Defect Tracking
- Test Reporting

## Group B — Test levels (unit / integration / system / UAT)

- Definition, example, owners, failure signals for each level

## Group C — Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

- Boundary value Analysis (BVA) is a black-box testing technique that tests the edges of input ranges, where defects are most likely to occur.

Example:
 If a valid range is 1 to 10, we would test 0 (just below), 1 (on), 2 (just inside), 9 (just inside), 10 (on), and 11 (just above).

- Concept, 3 examples, edge cases

## Group D — Black-box techniques — Equivalence Partitioning

Equivalence partitioning is a core black-box testing design technique where the input domain of a software application is divided into groups of data, or "partitions," that are expected to be handled the same way by the system. This method significantly reduces the number of test cases needed while still ensuring comprehensive test coverage, as testing one representative value from each partition is considered sufficient to test the entire group.
